# Cognitive State Analysis with EEGNet and ATCNet 🧠🔍

## Overview

Welcome to the **Cognitive State Analysis** repository! Here, we explore the fascinating world of cognitive states using cutting-edge deep learning models: **EEGNet** and **ATCNet**. Let's dive in!

## 1. Cognitive States 🌟

Understanding cognitive states is like deciphering the brain's secret code. Here are the key states we'll explore:

- **Attention** 👀: Imagine your brain as a spotlight. When you're focused on a task or a captivating movie, your attention state is in full swing. EEG helps us peek into this spotlight.

- **Relaxation** 😌: Ah, the blissful moments when stress melts away. Relaxation is essential for mental well-being. EEG captures those serene brain waves during meditation or a lazy Sunday afternoon.

- **Alertness** 🚨: Ever had that "I need coffee" feeling? Alertness keeps us awake, vigilant, and ready to tackle challenges. EEG reveals the brain's wake-up call.

- **Meditation** 🧘‍♂️: Picture a serene mountaintop. Meditation takes us there. EEG shows us the brain's zen mode.

## 2. EEG (Electroencephalogram) and EEG Data 📊

- **EEG**: Electroencephalogram records brain activity using electrodes placed on your scalp. It's like eavesdropping on neurons having a chat. 🧠💬

- **EEG Data**: These brainwave recordings come in time-series form. Think of them as brain symphonies—each electrode playing its unique melody. 🎵📈

## 3. EEGNet and ATCNet Models 🤖

### EEGNet 🌐
